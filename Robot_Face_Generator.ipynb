    "# Robot Face Generator Tool # \n",
    "Written by: Jasper Bosschart\n",
    "## Context ##\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a tool that can generate robot faces using Image Generation AI. <br>\n",
    "The tool is built around the HuggingFace🤗 [Diffusers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index) library. This library can be used to access a wide variety of AI models available on the HuggingFace🤗 [website](https://huggingface.co/). The tool uses an Image Generation Model called [\"stable-diffusion-v1-5\"](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) by runwayml. <br>\n",
    "The tool is still a work in progress and is subjected to change. It is currently built within Jupyter Notebook using Python, as this allows the file to be ran off a webserver. This is necessary as the tool requires large amounts of computational power, something a simple laptop is not able to handle. Future development might enable for a standalone application.\n",
    "## Sources ##\n",
